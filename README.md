# Arduino UNO sketch: Send midi notes via USB
Send basic midi notes via the USB. In order to send midi to a DAW, it requires using Hairless Midi Serial and LoopBe.

Run the code in Arduino IDE
Depends on the Midi Library which can be installed easily via the Library Manager https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/midi-library/

Basically using the code from this page https://bvavra.github.io/MIDI_Accordion/sending-midi/

Make sure the baud rate is set to 115200, which is the baud rate defined in the code.

### Loop Be 1 - A Free Virtual MIDI Driver

LoopBe1 is an internal MIDI device for transferring MIDI data between computer programs. Basically LoopBe1 is an "invisible cable" to connect a MIDI outport of an application to any other applicationÂ´s MIDI inport.
